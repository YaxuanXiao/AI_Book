  <h1>Preface</h1>
  <p>This book is meant to be read together - you and your child, side by side. As you read, pause at the pages that spark questions. Let your child point at the devices around your home and find the AI hiding inside them. The goal isn't for your child to walk away with a perfect definition of AI. It's for them to feel curious, unafraid, and confident that they are in charge of the technology in their world and not the other way around. So take your time, the best learning happens right there, between the pages and the two of you.</p>
